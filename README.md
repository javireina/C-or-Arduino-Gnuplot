# C-or-Arduino-Gnuplot
Arduino serial plotter is kinda trash and C++ does not even do plots easily, with this repository you will have the essentials to visualize more data on your PC screen in a few minutes. It is necessary to download (not to install) gnuplot [http://www.gnuplot.info/] and CoolTerm (only if you use Arduino) [https://freeware.the-meiers.org/]
